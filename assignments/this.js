/* The for principles of "this";
* in your own words. explain the four principle for the "this" keyword below.
*
* 1. Global binding: The value of 'this' is equal to the window or console where JS is running.
* 2. Implicit binding: Whenever a function is called by a preceding dot, the object to the left of the dot is 'this'.

* 4. Explicit binding: When a JS cal or apply method is used, 'this is explicitly defined.
*
* write out a code example of each explanation above
